1. how to create a new branch
	a) git checkout -b local-branch-name repo-name/remote-branch-name
	b) git checkout --track local-branch-name repo-name/remote-branch-name
don't use this method:
	c) git branch local-branch-name
	   git chechout local-branch-name
because, a),b) will sync the local branch with remote branch in repo
automatically, but c) will not make local branch sync with remote branch.

2. how to push, pull code
	a) git push [repo-name] [local-branch-name]:[remote-branch-name]
if you ignore remote-branch-name( and ":"), remote branch name will be the
same as local branch name;
if ignore both local and remote branch name, all local branches will be
push to repo.
	b) git pull [repo-name] [remote-branch-name]:[local-branch-name]
if you ignore local-branch-name( and ":"), then local-branch-name will be
the same as remote branch name;
if ignore both local and remote branch name, all remote branches will be
pull from repo.
git pull is equivalent to:
	git fetch repo-name remote-branch-name
	git merge repo-name/remote-branch-name
